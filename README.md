# freeCodeCamp Front End Development Libraries Projects - Project 2 - Build a Random Quote Machine

See the result here: http://LaurentLabine.github.io/fcc-frontend-random-quote-generator/

I built this project as part of freeCodeCamp's curriculum to learn and practice Responsive Web Design.

## Technologies

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)

It is built using the React Library coupled with Redux for state Management and Styled-Components for the styling

It answers the technical requirements as stated in the challenge located here: https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-random-quote-machine with the tests that can be run from the page itself.
