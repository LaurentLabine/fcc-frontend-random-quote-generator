# freeCodeCamp Front End Development Libraries Projects - Build a Random Quote Machine
I built this project as part of freeCodeCamp's curriculum to learn and practice Responsive Web Design.

It is accessible here: http://LaurentLabine.github.io/fcc-random-quote-generator/

It is built using the React Library coupled with Redux for state Management and Styled-Components for the styling

And answers the technical requirements stated in the challenge located here: https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-random-quote-machine

The project has been initialized using create-react-app package and gh-pages has been added for hosting.

To deploy a new version on github pages use :

npm run deploy

To start locally:

npm start
